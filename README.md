# O-C extract
O-C diagram calculator code for periodic variable stars
v.0.1.

A python based code for the extraction of O-C diagrams used for the analyis on Classical Cepheid variable stars as described in Cs√∂rnyei et al. (2021). The code itself requires a lot of by-hand-tuning at the moment, and is not compatible with the up-to-date version of python at the moment, due to the changes in the subprocess module. This repository presently serves only as a reference for the analysis conducted for the article, however the code itself will be patched up in the near future. If you plan to run this code in its present from, then the following packages should be installed:

- Python 3.6.5

- Astropy

- Pandas

- scipy

- PyAstronomy

- numpy

- matplotlib
